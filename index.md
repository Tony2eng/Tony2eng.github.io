# Anthony Reynel Naquira's Portfolio 

I am a electrical engineering major at CSUF and I plan to graduate with this degree in 2028. I would say that what really drives me is to create stuff and that is why chose to be an engineer. This class has been a lot of fun and a lot of learning. It was hard to understand at first and maybe even throughout the whole semester but I can say I came out of this class with more knowledge than I went in with. It had its high and lows with understanding a concept and then realizing maybe it has more use to it, but it was definitely worth it. I hope I build a strong base in my present so that it can show off in the future. I'll keep working hard and trying out new things even if I don't completely understand an idea or concept, but one thing is for sure, i'll keep improving and learning from failures because that is the only way to move forward.

## My favorite CPSC 120 Labs 

* Lab 4 Part 2:
	
    I enjoy this lab so much because it was basically the start of me understanding the basic concepts of computer science. It was fun and it technically was the easiest lab for our team since it was done fast and everybody was on the same page. Making this little game and getting to run it was my favorite part. 

* Lab 6 Part 1:
	
    This lab for me was one of my favorites since I started to get the hang of the “if” statements on that lab and how to implement them. After that I also started teaching it to my partner of what I understood. And it was overall a great lab and one to remember since it was also implementing arguments into the code and finally finishing it and seeing it run properly was so great.

* Lab 8 Part 2: 
	
    Finally this lab was a great one as well since I got finally to work with loops and trying it out and understanding it visually was really helpful. It was my first time implementing the loop into a code and understanding was very difficult but then I began to see how it would run and it would help to understand what it was doing. Not only that but that visual created by the code was exceptionally useful, it help to get a grasp of loops into the later labs so this part was essential for me.
