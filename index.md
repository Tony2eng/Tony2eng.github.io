## My favorite CPSC 120 Labs 

Lab 4 Part 2:
	I enjoy this lab so much because it was basically the start of me understanding the basic concepts of computer science. It was fun and it technically was the easiest lab for our team since it was done fast and everybody was on the same page. Making this little game and getting to run it was my favorite part. 

Lab 6 Part 1:
	This lab for me was one of my favorites since I started to get the hang of the “if” statements on that lab and how to implement them. After that I also started teaching it to my partner of what I understood. And it was overall a great lab and one to remember since it was also implementing arguments into the code and finally finishing it and seeing it run properly was so great.

Lab 8 Part 2: 
	Finally this lab was a great one as well since I got finally to work with loops and trying it out and understanding it visually was really helpful. It was my first time implementing the loop into a code and understanding was very difficult but then I began to see how it would run and it would help to understand what it was doing. Not only that but that visual created by the code was exceptionally useful, it help to get a grasp of loops into the later labs so this part was essential for me.
